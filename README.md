The DOM is the result of years of implementation-specific inventions kept
for backwards compatibility and patterns that simply have no place in
Javascript. This makes **the DOM slow and ugly.**
While we can't easily solve the performance issues, this module attempts
to make the DOM API more usable.

This module should be kept lightweight and straightforward. If you see a
feature that can't be achieved simply with the current API, or if you think
that a feature proves to be useless, please
